# Unity-News-API
An API for Unity that will download text files and display them in a UI(canvas) text object.

Then Place the Text Object Where You Like.

The 'Text When Failed' Attribute indicates the text displayed when the game cant get access to the internet. You can edit this directly to change the failed text.
