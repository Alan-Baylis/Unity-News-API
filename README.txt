# Unity-News-API
An API for Unity that will download text files and display them in a UI(canvas) text object.

Attach This Script/Component to a UI Text object and edit the Url variable IN THE EDITOR.

Then Place the Text Object Where You Like.

The 'Text When Failed' Attribute indicates the text displayed when the game cant get access to the internet. You can edit this directly to change the failed text.

CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTS .TXT FILES, IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ADD A HTML AND MAYBE CSS INTERPRETER, THEN SUPPORT THE PROJECT BY DOWNLOADING AND USING IN YOUR GAMES.

Make sure that when you use this API, you credit me as 'TobyChaddertonGAMES'.
